thanks for the opportunity, tradeblock team. this was an interesting problem.

i left some comments throughout my code and a quick summary of the whole process should be in main.py's main method. the files that i did not take from the ftx exchange github should have comments at the top of the file explaining the gist of what is being done and some summary of my issues with it.

i left an 'explicit_installations.txt' file but i only really used conda to install websockets and requests if i recall correctly.

look forward to catching up about this! talk to you all later.
